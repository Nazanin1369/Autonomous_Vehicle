# Programming a Real Self-Driving Car.

## System Architecture
The architecture of the system is depicted below. The system consists of three key modules:  Perception ,Planning , and  Control . Each module consists of one or more ROS nodes, which utilize  publish/subscribe (pub-sub) and request/response patterns to communicate critical information with each other while   processing   information   that   helps   to   drive   the   car.

At a high level perspective, the  Perception module includes functionality that perceives the environment using attached sensors (cameras, lidars, radars, etc.), such as lane lines, traffic lights, obstacles on the road, state of traffic lights, etc. This information is passed to the  Planning module, which includes functionality to ingest the perceived environment, and uses that to publish a series of waypoints ahead of the car along with target velocities. The waypoints constitute a projected trajectory for the car. The  Control module takes the waypoints and executes the target velocities on the carâ€™s controller. The car is equipped with a drive-by-wire (DBW) functionality that allows the controller to set its  throttle (acceleration and deceleration),  brake and  steering angle commands. When the commands are executed, the car drives itself on the calculated trajectory. The entire   cycle   repeats   itself   continually   so   that   the   car   continues   driving. The modules are implemented as a set of ROS Nodes.

## Installation

Please use **one** of the two installation options, either native **or** docker installation.

### Native Installation

* Be sure that your workstation is running Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial Xerus or Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahir. [Ubuntu downloads can be found here](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop).
* If using a Virtual Machine to install Ubuntu, use the following configuration as minimum:
  * 2 CPU
  * 2 GB system memory
  * 25 GB of free hard drive space

  The Udacity provided virtual machine has ROS and Dataspeed DBW already installed, so you can skip the next two steps if you are using this.

* Follow these instructions to install ROS
  * [ROS Kinetic](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu) if you have Ubuntu 16.04.
  * [ROS Indigo](http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu) if you have Ubuntu 14.04.
* [Dataspeed DBW](https://bitbucket.org/DataspeedInc/dbw_mkz_ros)
  * Use this option to install the SDK on a workstation that already has ROS installed: [One Line SDK Install (binary)](https://bitbucket.org/DataspeedInc/dbw_mkz_ros/src/81e63fcc335d7b64139d7482017d6a97b405e250/ROS_SETUP.md?fileviewer=file-view-default)
* Download the [Udacity Simulator](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Capstone/releases).

### Docker Installation
[Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

Build the docker container
```bash
docker build . -t capstone
```

Run the docker file
```bash
docker run -p 4567:4567 -v $PWD:/capstone -v /tmp/log:/root/.ros/ --rm -it capstone
```

### Port Forwarding
To set up port forwarding, please refer to the [instructions from term 2](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/16cf4a78-4fc7-49e1-8621-3450ca938b77)

### Usage

1. Clone the project repository

2. Install python dependencies
```bash
cd CarND-Capstone
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Make and run styx
```bash
cd ros
catkin_make
source devel/setup.sh
roslaunch launch/styx.launch
```
4. Run the simulator

### Real world testing
1. Download [training bag](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/traffic_light_bag_file.zip) that was recorded on the Udacity self-driving car.
2. Unzip the file
```bash
unzip traffic_light_bag_file.zip
```
3. Play the bag file
```bash
rosbag play -l traffic_light_bag_file/traffic_light_training.bag
```
4. Launch your project in site mode
```bash
cd CarND-Capstone/ros
roslaunch launch/site.launch
```
5. Confirm that traffic light detection works on real life images
